/**
 * Deserialization target for a connector's <b>Trigger Metadata</b>
 * ({@code resources/trigger-metadata.json}) — a small, display-only sibling of the (much larger)
 * {@code trigger-model.json}. It carries what a project-tree / left-panel renderer needs to show an
 * entry-point artifact: its display name, an {@link IconDescriptor} (any of url/glyph/color/kind), and
 * the annotation field(s) (in preference order) that supply the instance-label suffix (e.g.
 * {@code "FTP Integration - /home/in"}).
 *
 * <p>Deliberately kept separate from {@code TriggerModel}: reading the full form/service-type/handler
 * schema just to paint a tree node would mean deserializing a document an order of magnitude larger
 * than what the tree actually needs.
 *
 * @param displayName  the label shown for the artifact, e.g. {@code "RabbitMQ Event Integration"}
 * @param icon         the connector-declared {@link IconDescriptor} (any of {@code url}, {@code glyph},
 *                     {@code color}, {@code kind}); all fields optional. The resolver fills {@code url}
 *                     (Central/package) and {@code source} when absent. {@code null} when undeclared.
 * @param labelFields  service-annotation field names to try, in order, for the instance-label suffix
 *                     (e.g. {@code ["queueName", "topicName"]}); {@code null}/empty means no suffix
 * @since 1.9.0
