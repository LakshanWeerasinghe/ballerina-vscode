/**
 * A trigger picker entry, loaded once (as a flat map) from {@code trigger_properties.json}.
 *
 * <p>{@code version}/{@code icon}/{@code kind} are optional, populated only for a schema-driven
 * trigger (transcribed from its {@code trigger-model.json}'s own top-level fields at onboarding time).
 * When present, {@link ServiceModelGeneratorService} builds the trigger's {@link TriggerBasicInfo}
 * directly from these scalars, without parsing/caching the connector's full (potentially large,
 * deeply-nested) {@code TriggerModel} just to populate the picker list. A legacy trigger (e.g. HTTP,
 * which has no schema-driven model at all) simply omits them, falling back to the sqlite index derived
 * from {@code service_artifacts.json}.
 *
 * @param name        the trigger's display name
 * @param orgName     the organization name of the connector package
 * @param packageName the connector package name
 * @param keywords    keywords used to search/filter this trigger in the picker
 * @param triggerName the trigger's unique identifier
 * @param version     the connector package version, populated only for a schema-driven trigger
 * @param icon        the trigger's icon path, populated only for a schema-driven trigger
 * @param kind        the trigger kind, populated only for a schema-driven trigger
